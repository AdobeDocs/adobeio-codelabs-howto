## Requirements

The only pre-requisite is to have a github account. If you don't have an account, go to https://github.com/join to create one.

To be able to preview a codelab, we also recommend to:
 
* Install `npm`. Go to https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm to get npm.
* Install `hlx`. Go to https://www.project-helix.io/ to get started.
